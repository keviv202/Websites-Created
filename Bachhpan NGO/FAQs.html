          <h1 style="color:#000"> FAQ</h1>
          <h3 style="font-weight:400;">1. What is Bachhpan?</h3>
          <p>We are the Student organization working against a sensitive issue of child labour and promoting our cause through different colleges. We believe that being lucky to have gained the gift of knowledge it is our moral duty to help those unfortunate children working for their livelihood.</p>
          
          <h3 style="font-weight:400;">2. What does Bachhpan do?</h3>
          <p>Children are the focus of Bachhpan organization. We understand that school is the only best place to work for children and not streets or industries where they are forced to work. So we work to save such children from clutches of child labour and provide them future they deserve through education and other basic needs of their families.</p>
          
          
          <h3 style="font-weight:400;">3. How is a child benefited from our organization?</h3>
          <p>It is a right of every child to gain education, to live a life of safety, and protect against exploitation and abuse. Thus child thrown to work at early ages is subjected to mental and physical distress and also a meaningless future. Thus if we are able to change life of such children through motivation and education we can break the chain of everlasting poverty, unemployment and exploitation.</p>
          
          
          <h3 style="font-weight:400;">4. How do we raise funds?</h3>
          <p>We believe that every student member of our organization should donate a reasonable amount of 100/- from student and 250/- Rs from others every month which will help to change lives of many children and be inspiration for others. We believe in Commitments rather than one time donations, and so we request continuous donations every month so the children can get the future they were promised.</p>
          
          
          <h3 style="font-weight:400;">5. Are only students allowed to donate?</h3>
          <p>No, anyone above age of 18 is allowed to donate. We welcome everyone wishing to support this good cause since there are many children out there seeking for help.</p>
          
          
           <h3 style="font-weight:400;">6. Don’t you think Rs250/- every month is a big ask?</h3>
          <p>Yes, it may look a big ask in first go. But if you change your perspective, it means only just 8.5/- rs a day which we spend daily without even noticing and it just 1% of your monthly salary. So if you donate this 1% of salary for a good cause which can completely change lives of many, it is totally worth. .</p>
          
          
           <h3 style="font-weight:400;">7. How would children be benefited from these donations?</h3>
          <p>The entire donation given to our organization is used for the welfare of the children. We take full responsibility of such selected student to provide them education, improve their economic condition, and provide medicines, food, books and stationary and also scholarships for bright children. Also such children will be provided with a savings account in which some amount will be deposited every month and the total saving would be given to him/her after they complete 18 years to build their future..</p>
          
          
          
           <h3 style="font-weight:400;">8. How can I be sure that the money I donate is managed correctly?</h3>
          <p>We are a Non profitable organization and thus every penny donated to us is used for welfare of children. To maintain transparency we have decided to display the balance sheet of total expenses on our website every month. Also any donor is free to inspect any child selected for our program and can ask for the progress report.</p>
          
          
               <h3 style="font-weight:400;">9. How do we as an organization monitor that our program is implemented successfully?</h3>
          <p>Our volunteer visits the children and their family once every month for counselling session to better understand their needs and submits a report to higher levels. Also we consult schools in which these children are studying to monitor their attendance and progress and proper steps are taken to monitor that they don’t indulge in any kind of labour whatsoever.</p>
